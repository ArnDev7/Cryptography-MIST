## Flags

Used flags translator(the following) to decypher the code:

 ## miniRSA

 this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) was very useful for information about RSA.

 I had help from the python code given [here](https://l34rn-p14y.blogspot.com/2014/03/inctf-2014-crypto-200.html) to decrypt the ciphertext

## transposition-trial

Referred to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHsnH1u03e4) for knowledge

**(While looking to decode, I got to know about the different types of ciphers [here](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/cipher-identifier#unknown-format))**

Took a lot of time to find the best decoding platform to solve this particular problem

used `https://tholman.com/other/transposition/`. *I put the key length 3, as mentioned. Then rearranged the third column to get the key*
